    <p>
      At FloraGatos, we believe nature shouldn’t be a luxury—it should be part
      of daily life. With today’s fast-paced lifestyle, many people lose their
      connection to the natural world. That’s why we created FloraGatos: to make
      it easy to enjoy the beauty and benefits of indoor plants.
